Hi there, I’m jessenjoseph

I am a full-stack Engineer. My latest role was in the Fintech industry https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessen-joseph-sajith/

I love talking and reading about #humility, #kindness, #KindnessIsPowerful #emotionalinvesting #humor #diligence #benefitsofwfh #cloudcomputing and real life experiences/testimonials.

I have architected complex systems throughout my career in Netwealth, 
led many technical discussions and 
helped build high-impact, scalable, performant complex products used & commended by everyone in Netwealth. 

Quality takes time and effort and it's obvious to everyone who has worked with me that 
I’m very committed to ensuring high-quality standards on every product with sheer hard work and determination. 
I have a proven track record of consistently choosing the optimal strategy/course of action using the available resources for any given task/product.

Though I had opened a GitHub account long long ago, ive only started using it since Nov 22. But I am an active coder and enjoy coding and solving business problems.
